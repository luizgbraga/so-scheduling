# SO Scheduling

This repository contains a university project that required simulating a multiple queue scheduling algorithm with feedback, where one queue uses round-robin scheduling and the other uses FCFS (First-Come, First-Served) scheduling. Scheduling between queues is done based on priority and with preemption, and there is only one I/O device.
